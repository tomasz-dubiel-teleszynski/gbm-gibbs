Folder description:
-------------

  data*: Excel file with three sheets of data, total income at country and bank level and operating cost
   funs: functions used to calculate different things in the bailout model such as time, threshold or value for gov
    gbm: Bayesian estimation routines for geometric brownian motion
    llt: local linear trend model to identify outliers, structural breaks and slope changes
  mats*: exemplary mat files with outputs which are saved when scripts are run
scripts: routines which are run in particular order to replicate results as in the bailout paper

* data from commercial provided hence removed

-------------
Scripts running order related to main part (AUTO - automatic, MANU - manual/user inspection recommended, only for private and gov cost):
-------------

AUTO 1) cmusigGBM.m  - to obtain parameters of gbm at country level
AUTO 2) bmusigGBM.m  - to obtain parameters of gbm at bank level using country parameters as priors
MANU 3) cvcgLLTman.m - to obtain cost estimates for private investor and government, set at the moment to use stored breka points
		       but for new data can be used semi-automatically/manually to investigate outputs of the llt model and 
		       identify new breakpoint storing them online and using these to differentiate between these two costs
AUTO 4) final_cTI_and_bTC.m - main script to calculate all variables of interest using gbm country parameters for all the banks
			      where results need to be taken manually from workspace and organized in tables like in the paper.
AUTO 5) final_bTI_and_bTC.m - main script to calculate all variables of interest using gbm individual bank parameters where
			      results need to be taken manually from workspace and organized in tables like in the paper.
AUTO 6) Gcalcs.m - additional script to calculate value of a bnank for the government following bailout.

-------------
Scripts running order related to NII part (comments above apply):
-------------

AUTO 1) cmusigGBMnii.m 
AUTO 2) bmusigGBMnii.m
MANU 3) cvcgLLTman.m - does not have to be run if corresponding mat file is already there
AUTO 4) final_cTI_and_bTCnii.m
AUTO 5) final_bTI_and_bTCnii.m			  
AUTO 6) Gcalcsnii.m
